Mirix
=====

**Mirix** is a highly awesome interpreted language that you will really want to use. It is written in C# so that we can get it running everywhere due to .NET Core being available on Windows, Linux and Max OSX these days (for x86 and ARM).

## A taste of Mirix

An example program is written below:

````
function main()
{
    println("Hello and welcome to the world or Mirix!");
}
````
